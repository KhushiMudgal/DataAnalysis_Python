# Healthcare Analytics Project – Hospital Readmission Prediction

## Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end healthcare analytics case study** focused on **predicting 30-day hospital readmissions for diabetes patients**.
The goal is to analyze real-world healthcare data and identify patterns that can help **reduce readmission rates, lower costs, and improve patient outcomes**.

The entire project is implemented using **Python**.

---

## Objective

* Analyze hospital data related to diabetes patients
* Understand factors affecting **hospital readmissions**
* Perform data cleaning, analysis, and modeling
* Create meaningful insights for healthcare decision-making

---

## Dataset

* **Diabetes 130-US Hospitals Dataset (1999–2008)**
* Source: **UCI Machine Learning Repository**
* Contains patient demographics, medical history, diagnoses, and hospital outcomes

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* Libraries used:

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Scikit-learn

---

## Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Acquisition

* Loaded healthcare data from UCI repository
* Initial inspection of structure and columns

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Handled missing and invalid values
* Replaced unknown categories
* Feature engineering and data transformation

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Univariate and bivariate analysis
* Studied relationships between patient features and readmissions
* Visualized trends and patterns

### 4️⃣ Model Building

* Built predictive models for hospital readmission
* Evaluated model performance
* Identified important features influencing readmission

---

## Key Learnings

* Real-world healthcare data is **messy and complex**
* Proper **data cleaning** is critical before analysis
* Certain patient factors strongly influence readmission rates
* Visualization helps in understanding healthcare trends
* End-to-end documentation improves project clarity
